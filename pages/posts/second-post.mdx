# Advanced Next.js Features

Published on July 28, 2025

In this second blog post, we'll explore some more advanced features of Next.js that can
enhance your web development experience.

## API Routes

Next.js provides a solution to build your API with JavaScript. Any file inside the folder
pages/api is mapped to /api/* and will be treated as an API endpoint instead of a page.

## Static Site Generation (SSG)

Next.js allows you to pre-render pages at build time. This can improve performance and SEO
by generating HTML at build time instead of on each request.

```javascript
export async function getStaticProps() {
  // Fetch data from external API
  const res = await fetch('https://api.example.com/data')
  const data = await res.json()

  // Pass data to the page via props
  return { props: { data } }
}
```

## Incremental Static Regeneration

Next.js allows you to create or update static pages after you've built your site.
This means you can pre-render pages at build time and then update them without
rebuilding the entire site.
