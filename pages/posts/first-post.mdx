# My First Blog Post

Published on July 26, 2025

This is my first blog post using Next.js. Next.js is a React framework that enables 
server-side rendering and generating static websites for React based web applications.

It's a great choice for blogs because it provides:

- Fast page loads with server-side rendering
- SEO-friendly pages
- Simple routing based on the file system
- API routes for backend functionality

In this blog, I'll be sharing my thoughts on various topics related to web development,
machine learning, and more.

## Getting Started with Next.js

To create a Next.js app, you can use the following command:

```bash
npx create-next-app@latest my-blog
```

This sets up everything you need to get started, including the project structure,
configuration files, and dependencies.
